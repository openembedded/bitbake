Changes in BitBake 1.4.2:
	- Send logs to oe.pastebin.com instead of pastebin.com
	  fixes #856
	- Copy the internal bitbake data before building the
	  dependency graph. This fixes nano not having a
	  virtual/libc dependency
	- Allow multiple TARBALL_STASH entries
	- Cache, check if the directory exists before changing
	  into it
	- git speedup cloning by not doing a checkout
	- allow to have spaces in filenames (.conf, .bb, .bbclass)

Changes in BitBake 1.4.0:
	- Fix to check both RDEPENDS and RDEPENDS_${PN}
	- Fix a RDEPENDS parsing bug in utils:explode_deps()
	- Update git fetcher behaviour to match git changes
	- ASSUME_PROVIDED allowed to include runtime packages
	- git fetcher cleanup and efficency improvements
	- Change the format of the cache
	- Update usermanual to document the Fetchers
	- Major changes to caching with a new strategy
	  giving a major performance increase when reparsing
	  with few data changes

Changes in BitBake 1.3.3:
	- Create a new Fetcher module to ease the
	  development of new Fetchers.
	  Issue #438 fixed by rpurdie@openedhand.com
	- Make the Subversion fetcher honor the SRC Date
	  (CVSDATE).
	  Issue #555 fixed by chris@openedhand.com
	- Expand PREFERRED_PROVIDER properly
	  Issue #436 fixed by rprudie@openedhand.com
	- Typo fix for Issue #531 by Philipp Zabel for the
	  BitBake Shell
	- Introduce a new special variable SRCDATE as
	  a generic naming to replace CVSDATE.
	- Introduce a new keyword 'required'. In contrast
	  to 'include' parsing will fail if a to be included
	  file can not be found.
	- Remove hardcoding of the STAMP directory. Patch
	  courtsey pHilipp Zabel
	- Track the RDEPENDS of each package (rpurdie@openedhand.com)
	- Introduce BUILD_ALL_DEPS to build all RDEPENDS. E.g
	  this is used by the OpenEmbedded Meta Packages.
	  (rpurdie@openedhand.com).

Changes in BitBake 1.3.2:
	- reintegration of make.py into BitBake
	- bbread is gone, use bitbake -e
	- lots of shell updates and bugfixes
	- Introduction of the .= and =. operator
	- Sort variables, keys and groups in bitdoc
	- Fix regression in the handling of BBCOLLECTIONS
	- Update the bitbake usermanual

Changes in BitBake 1.3.0:
	- add bitbake interactive shell (bitbake -i)
	- refactor bitbake utility in OO style
	- kill default arguments in methods in the bb.data module
	- kill default arguments in methods in the bb.fetch module
	- the http/https/ftp fetcher will fail if the to be 
	  downloaded file was not found in DL_DIR (this is needed
	  to avoid unpacking the sourceforge mirror page)
	- Switch to a cow like data instance for persistent and non
	  persisting mode (called data_smart.py)
	- Changed the callback of bb.make.collect_bbfiles to carry
	  additional parameters
	- Drastically reduced the amount of needed RAM by not holding
	  each data instance in memory when using a cache/persistent
	  storage

Changes in BitBake 1.2.1:
	The 1.2.1 release is meant as a intermediate release to lay the
	ground for more radical changes. The most notable changes are:

	- Do not hardcode {}, use bb.data.init() instead if you want to
	  get a instance of a data class
	- bb.data.init() is a factory and the old bb.data methods are delegates
	- Do not use deepcopy use bb.data.createCopy() instead.
	- Removed default arguments in bb.fetch

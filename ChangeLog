	  development of new Fetchers.
	  Issue #438 fixed by rpurdie@openedhand.com
	- Make the Subversion fetcher honor the SRC Date

	  Issue #436 fixed by rprudie@openedhand.com
	- Typo fix for Issue #531 by Philipp Zabel for the
	  BitBake Shell
	- Introduce a new special variable SRCDATE as

	  to 'include' parsing will fail if a to be included
	  file can not be found.
	- Remove hardcoding of the STAMP directory. Patch
	  courtsey pHilipp Zabel
	- Track the RDEPENDS of each package (rpurdie@openedhand.com)
	- Introduce BUILD_ALL_DEPS to build all RDEPENDS. E.g
	  this is used by the OpenEmbedded Meta Packages.
	  (rpurdie@openedhand.com).

Changes in BitBake 1.3.2:
	- reintegration of make.py into BitBake
	- bbread is gone, use bitbake -e

	- Update the bitbake usermanual

Changes in BitBake 1.3.0:
	- add bitbake interactive shell (bitbake -i)
	- refactor bitbake utility in OO style
	- kill default arguments in methods in the bb.data module
	- kill default arguments in methods in the bb.fetch module
	- the http/https/ftp fetcher will fail if the to be 
	  downloaded file was not found in DL_DIR (this is needed
	  to avoid unpacking the sourceforge mirror page)
	- Switch to a cow like data instance for persistent and non
	  persisting mode (called data_smart.py)
	- Changed the callback of bb.make.collect_bbfiles to carry
	  additional parameters
	- Drastically reduced the amount of needed RAM by not holding
	  each data instance in memory when using a cache/persistent
	  storage

Changes in BitBake 1.2.1:
	The 1.2.1 release is meant as a intermediate release to lay the
	ground for more radical changes. The most notable changes are:

	- Do not hardcode {}, use bb.data.init() instead if you want to
	  get a instance of a data class
	- bb.data.init() is a factory and the old bb.data methods are delegates
	- Do not use deepcopy use bb.data.createCopy() instead.
	- Removed default arguments in bb.fetch

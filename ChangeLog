	  to avoid unpacking the sourceforge mirror page)
	- Switch to a cow like data instance for persistent and non
	  persisting mode (called data_smart.py)
	- Changed the callback of bb.make.collect_bbfiles to carry
	  additional parameters
	- Drastically reduced the amount of needed RAM by not holding
	  each data instance in memory when using a cache/persistent
	  storage

Changes in BitBake 1.2.1:
	The 1.2.1 release is meant as a intermediate release to lay the
	ground for more radical changes. The most notable changes are:

	- Do not hardcode {}, use bb.data.init() instead if you want to
	  get a instance of a data class
	- bb.data.init() is a factory and the old bb.data methods are delegates
	- Do not use deepcopy use bb.data.createCopy() instead.
	- Removed default arguments in bb.fetch

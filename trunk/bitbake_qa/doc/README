Bitbake QA will hold Quality Assurance Resources:
	The primary user will be OpenEmbedded but it is useful
for any other user bitbake as well.

layout of the bitbake_qa module:
conf/
	It contains example configurations used to run tests
with specified parameters (for overrides)

doc/
	This directory

module_name/
	QA modules doing the actual tests


I hope to offer the following tests soon:

source_checker - It will check if the sources can still be fetched
		 and generates reports

patch_checker  - It will check if the patches still applies

doc_checker    - It will check if all variables have a documentation

content_checker - It will check for common misusage in variables

tinderbox_resources - It will contain resources to run a tinderbox server
		      and client.
